## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Business Objective
**Key Business Outcome**:
Generate phone calls requests from high-quality prospects who meet GC's qualified client criteria ($200K+ minimum, accredited).

**Specific Conversion Path:**
The website needs to serve prospects who:
- Have never heard of Glenorchy Capital
- Are researching alternative investment managers
- Need concrete proof before committing $200K+ minimums
- Want to see actual performance, not just investment philosophy
- Are comparing GC against other boutique managers

**Critical Performance Elements:**
Track record showcase: 5-year performance data vs benchmarks
Transparency demonstration: Real portfolio positions, not generic marketing speak
Credibility indicators: SEC registration, regulatory compliance, professional backgrounds
Risk/return profile: Clear communication of the asymmetric approach and realistic expectations
Social proof: Client testimonials from the qualified client base

**Primary Call-to-Action:**
Schedule consultation call with principals Chris MacIntosh and Brad McFadden to discuss portfolio fit and investment process.

**Success Metrics:**
- Primary KPI: Form fills
- Timeline: Live website 30th September
- Budget: Internally funded with existing resources

Demographics: Exited founders, successful operators. Mean age 45 for top performers. Often concentrated wealth in business until liquidity event
Behavior: Leverage professional networks, consume business podcasts/newsletters, quick decision-makers when thesis aligns. Consult CFO/attorneys/accountants
Needs: Diversification away from concentrated positions, liquidity event management, tax-efficient strategies, co-investment access

**Inherited Wealth Recipients ($2M-$20M+ net worth)**

Behavior: Digital natives using social media for financial research, participate in YPO/Tiger 21 networks, value collaborative decision-making
Needs: Independence from legacy advisors, financial education, intergenerational governance, value-aligned investing (but anti-woke)

**Shared Behavioral Patterns**

Prefer educational content over sales pitches
Seek transparency and skin-in-the-game alignment
Distrust mainstream financial media and conventional wisdom
Value contrarian thinking and macro insights
Want global exposure without patriotic bias in allocation

**Pain Points This Site Solves**
**Investment Frustrations**
Mainstream Options Failure: Index funds, robo-advisors, ESG funds delivering mediocre returns while destroying quality of life through woke capitalism
Advisor Distrust: High fees (1-2% AUM) with no skin-in-the-game, closet indexing, beta-hugging strategies
Information Overload: Financial media noise vs. actionable macro insights
Geographic Limitations: US-only focus missing global opportunities

**Operational Pain Points**
Time Constraints: High-earners lack bandwidth for investment research
Complexity Management: Estate planning, tax optimization, liquidity events
Due Diligence Burden: Evaluating managers without transparent track records
Access Issues: Difficulty finding non-mainstream, institutional-quality managers

**Wealth Preservation Fears**
Inflation/Currency Risk: Fiat debasement and purchasing power erosion
Market Manipulation: Central bank distortions favoring financial assets over real economy
Concentration Risk: Over-exposure to home country bias or single sectors
Generational Wealth Loss: 70% of family wealth gone by second generation

**Expected User Journey and Conversion Path**
**Discovery Phase**
Referral Sources: Capitalist Exploits, Rebel Capitalist Show, Professional networks, existing client referrals, contrarian finance content consumption
Initial Research: Google search for "contrarian investment managers" or "global value investing"
Website Landing: Homepage or sector-specific content (energy, shipping, Argentina opportunities)

**Evaluation Phase**
Credibility Assessment: SEC registration, 5-year track record, regulatory compliance verification
Strategy Understanding: Deep-value methodology, global mandate, sector-first approach
Performance Review: Risk-adjusted returns vs benchmarks, downside protection evidence
Alignment Check: Anti-ESG positioning, skin-in-the-game verification, fee structure transparency

**Conversion Phase**
Contact Qualification: Brief form confirming accredited status, investable assets, investment timeline
Consultation Request: "Schedule Portfolio Consultation" CTA leading to Brad/Chris call
Phone Call: 30-minute strategy discussion, mutual fit assessment, minimum investment confirmation
Decision Making: Internal discussion with spouse/advisors, final due diligence
Onboarding: Managed account setup or fund subscription

**Critical Conversion Elements Needed on Site**
-Track Record Showcase: 5-year performance data with context
-Transparency Proof: Actual portfolio positions, not generic marketing
-Regulatory Credibility: SEC registration, Form ADV access, compliance emphasis
-Philosophy Alignment: Anti-mainstream positioning, contrarian case studies
-Fee Justification: Premium fees (2% + 20%) justified through performance and alignment
-Global Mandate Evidence: International portfolio positions, currency expertise
-Personal Investment: Brad/Chris capital committed alongside clients
-Qualification Process: Clear $200K minimum, accredited investor requirements

**Success Metrics**
-Qualified consultation requests (meeting minimum investment + accredited status)
-Conversion rate from consultation to account opening
-Average account size at opening
-Time from first website visit to funded account

**Secondary Users:**
**Professional Influencers & Gatekeepers**
CPAs/Tax Advisors: Often the first to recommend alternative managers when clients complain about returns
Estate Planning Attorneys: Regularly field questions about investment management for trusts/estates
Family Office Staff: Junior analysts who do initial due diligence screening
RIA/Fee-Only Advisors: May refer clients seeking alternatives outside their wheelhouse
Private Wealth Bankers: Sometimes recommend external managers for client alternatives

**Institutional Decision Makers**
Corporate 401k Plan Sponsors: High-earning employees who control their companies' retirement plans
Pension/Endowment Committees: Smaller institutions seeking alternatives
Multi-Family Office Partners: Who evaluate external managers for client allocations

**Due Diligence Ecosystem**
Investment Consultants: Who research managers for their clients
Compliance Officers: At institutions vetting your regulatory status
Risk Management Professionals: Evaluating your risk controls and processes

**Personal Network Influencers**
Spouses/Partners: Especially for inherited wealth or joint decision-making
Adult Children: Who research options for aging parents' portfolios
High-Net-Worth Peer Groups: Investment clubs, mastermind groups, CEO forums

**Key Insight:** These secondary audiences often do the initial "vetting" before your primary prospects ever reach the website. They need different proof points‚Äîregulatory compliance, professional credentials, institutional-quality processes‚Äîrather than just investment performance.

### Market Positioning
**How we differentiate:**
The Anti-Consensus Global Deep Value Specialist

**Messaging framework:**
Key Positioning Elements:

**"Professional Contrarian Management"** - Position against the diversified, consensus-driven approaches of competitors like Manning & Napier and RiverFront.
**"Sector-First Global Value"** - Differentiate from company-picker competitors and geographically-biased firms.
**"Institutional Quality Without Institutional Bias"** - Contrast with larger players like Rothschild who carry institutional baggage.

**Competitive Messaging Framework:**

**vs. Large Diversified Managers** (Manning & Napier, Baird): "While they spread risk across everything, we concentrate on asymmetric opportunities in unloved sectors"
**vs. ESG/Mainstream Funds** (Rathbones Greenbank): "We invest where capital is treated best, not where it's politically correct"
**vs. Geographic Specialists** "We're geography-agnostic - if value exists in Kazakhstan or Peru, we go there"
**vs. High-Fee Boutiques** (Killik & Co at ¬£750K min): "Similar boutique quality with transparent fees and skin in the game"

**Sweet Spot:** Position between the $200K-$500K minimum range as the "accessible contrarian specialist" - higher than mass market but lower than ultra-high-net-worth exclusive firms.
Target Competitive Set: Compete with Beutel Goodman's value approach but emphasize global reach and contrarian positioning versus their large-cap North American focus.
