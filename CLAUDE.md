## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL HTML DEVELOPMENT RULES ðŸš¨

### HTML Structure Rules:
1. **Clean semantic HTML5** - proper header, main, section, footer structure
2. **Mobile-first responsive CSS** - mobile design first, desktop enhanced
3. **Fast loading** - optimized images, minified CSS/JS
4. **SEO optimized** - proper meta tags, structured data, alt texts
